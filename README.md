# k8s-scribbles

This project contains various scripts, readme's etc that I collect(ed) during my journey into Kubernetes.

Especially focused on training for:

- [Certified Kubernetes Administrator](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-kubernetes-administrator-cka/) (CKA)
- [Certified Kubernetes Application Developer](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-kubernetes-application-developer-ckad/) (CKAD)
 
A great source for getting your hands dirty is Kelsey Hightowers [Kubernetes The Hard Way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way) Github repo.
